# Distributed_AI


Repository for final project for Siraj's Distributed Apps course.

## Overview

This notebook is an overview of the steps taken to implement OpenMined's Grid, the network that OpenMined implements to do distributed computation.


This is combined with OpenMined's demonstration of distributed tensor processing with torch, as well as how to run epochs on the Boston Housing Dataset.

This is not the full project, but is rather the most useful part of a project idea that was otherwise abandoned.


## TODO

- Integration with the rest of team-rocket's DApp
- Connection to a more reliable IPFS node (more reliable than a spare laptop)
- conversion to standalone python code instead of
