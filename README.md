# decentralized_AI

This is a first try at building a Decentralized AI.

```
docker build docker_keras_cpu/  -t dapps/keras:v0
docker run  dapps/keras:v0

```

=> It will train an AI to do OCR on the well known MNIST dataset.
Dockerfile is based on work from https://github.com/gw0/docker-keras , thanks to him.
